A recently \\narriving partial ASCAT-A overpass shows that the circulation has \\nbecome more elongated, and Peter lacks a well-defined center.  In \\naddition, the system has not produced any organized deep convection \\nin quite some time.  The cloudiness and convective activity that has \\nbeen occuring over the western Atlantic has been located along a \\ntrough axis well northeast of the decaying circulation center.  As a \\nresult, Peter no longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone, \\nand this will be the final NHC advisory on this system.  The initial \\nintensity is set at 25 kt in accordance with the ASCAT data.  The \\nremnants of Peter are expected to remain within an area of strong \\nupper-level westerly winds, and further weakening should occur over \\nthe next day or two. \\n\\nThe system has been moving slowly north-northwestward or 335/4 kt.  \\nA weakness in the low-level ridge should allow the remnants to turn \\nnorthward tomorrow, and this general motion should continue through \\nthe end of the week. \\n\\nThis is the last NHC advisory on this system. Additional information \\non the remnants of Peter can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued \\nby the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO \\nheader FZNT01 KWBC, and online at \\nocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php\\n\\n \\nFORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS\\n \\nINIT  23/0300Z 22.1N  67.0W   25 KT  30 MPH...REMNANTS\\n 12H  23/1200Z...DISSIPATED\\n \\n$$\\nForecaster Brown\\n \\n</pre>'},\n",

An analysis of the ambiguities from 0000 UTC ASCAT-B \\ndata suggests that the surface circulation is just barely closed, \\nwith the center still attached to the northern end of a trough.  \\nPeak wind retrievals from the scatterometer pass were 25-30 kt, so \\nthe initial intensity remains 30 kt.\\n\\nBased on the ASCAT data, the depression appears to be moving just \\nnorth of due west, or 275/13 kt.  Low- to mid-level ridging to the \\nnorth is expected to maintain the cyclone on a westward heading for \\nthe next 36 hours, followed by a path toward the west-northwest \\nfrom day 2 through day 5.  The more notable part of the forecast is \\nthe forward speed.  Global models are showing anomalously strong \\n500-mb ridging developing over the eastern and central Caribbean \\nSea in 2 to 3 days, which is likely to block the depression's \\nforward progress toward the end of the forecast period.  In fact, \\nthe current NHC forecast has the system moving west-northwestward \\nat only 7 or 8 kt well east of the Lesser Antilles on days 3 through \\n5.  All this means that it will probably be a few more days before \\nwe have a better idea if and how the system might potentially \\nthreaten areas farther west.  For the 5-day forecast period, there \\nis a normal amount of spread among the track guidance, and the \\nupdated NHC forecast is very close to a blend of the TVCA and HCCA \\nconsensus aids.  This solution is not too different from the \\nprevious forecast.\\n \\nOverall, an environment of low shear, warm sea surface \\ntemperatures, and a moist, unstable atmosphere appears conducive \\nfor strengthening.  However, there is some sort of signal being \\nconveyed by the global models (e.g., the GFS, ECMWF, and UKMET) \\nwhereby the cyclone's surface circulation does not really tighten \\nup for another 24 to 48 hours.  Given the system's current \\nstructure, this scenario seems plausible.  Therefore, the updated \\nNHC intensity forecast shows a slower rate of strengthening during \\nthe first 48 hours, just a bit below the intensity consensus in \\ndeference to the global model solutions.  After 48 hours, the \\nofficial forecast converges on top of the previous NHC forecast and \\nstill brings the cyclone to hurricane, and then possibly major \\nhurricane, strength by the end of the forecast period.  \\n\\n \\nFORECAST POSITIONS AND MAX WINDS\\n \\nINIT  23/0300Z 10.2N  35.0W   30 KT  35 MPH\\n 12H  23/1200Z 10.4N  37.0W   30 KT  35 MPH\\n 24H  24/0000Z 10.9N  39.6W   35 KT  40 MPH\\n 36H  24/1200Z 11.4N  42.1W   45 KT  50 MPH\\n 48H  25/0000Z 12.0N  44.3W   55 KT  65 MPH\\n 60H  25/1200Z 12.6N  46.0W   70 KT  80 MPH\\n 72H  26/0000Z 13.2N  47.5W   80 KT  90 MPH\\n 96H  27/0000Z 14.5N  50.2W   90 KT 105 MPH\\n120H  28/0000Z 16.0N  53.3W  100 KT 115 MPH\\n \\n$$\\nForecaster Berg\\n \\n</pre>\",\n",
