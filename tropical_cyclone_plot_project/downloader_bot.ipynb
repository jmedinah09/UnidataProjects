Just like yesterday morning, the \\nlow-level center of the storm is pulling away from the deep \\nconvection and is now displaced greater than 80 n mi. An Air Force \\nReserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft has been investigating Peter this \\nmorning and has measured peak 925-mb flight-level winds of 54 kt \\nand several SFMR values of 40-45 kt, supporting keeping the initial \\nintensity at 45 kt for this advisory.  \\n\\nPeter refuses to slow down, and for the past several hours has been \\nmoving 290/14 kt. This west-northwestward motion is forecast to \\ncontinue for the next two days as the system remains to the \\nsouthwest of a subtropical ridge. By Wednesday, Peter should slow \\ndown and turn northwest then north as it reaches a developing \\nweakness in the ridge carved out by a mid-latitude trough \\nmoving across the northeastern United States later this week. The \\nmodel track guidance has shifted slightly left for the 24-72 h time \\nframes, and the NHC forecast track was nudged in that direction as \\nwell. Otherwise, the latest NHC forecast track is little changed \\nfrom the previous one. \\n\\nAn upper-level trough to the west of Peter is forecast to remain \\nnear the cyclone for the next few days, keeping the storm in a \\nhigh-shear environment. Therefore, despite being over warm waters \\nthe storm is forecast to slowly weaken. If Peter survives the next \\n72 h, there could be a window of opportunity late in the forecast \\nperiod for some modest strengthening as the cyclone would have \\nlifted to the north of the upper trough. It should be noted that a \\nvast majority of the GFS ensembles show Peter dissipating later this \\nweek as the system opens into a wave. This scenario is plausible, \\nespecially if deep convection fails to persist near the center of \\nthe cyclone. The latest NHC intensity forecast assumes Peter \\nsurvives, and closely follows the various intensity consensus \\nsolutions.\\n \\nBased on the latest track, intensity, and wind radii forecasts, no\\ntropical storm watches or warnings are required for the northern\\nLeeward Islands, Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico at this time.\\nHowever, locally heavy rain is possible today and Tuesday when\\nPeter is expected to pass to the north of these locations.\\n \\n \\nKey Messages:\\n \\n1.

Rose is \\nstill expected to move generally northwestward around the \\nsouthwestern and western periphery of a strong subtropical ridge \\nduring the next few days.  Around day 3, however, a mid- to \\nupper-level trough over the north-central Atlantic is forecast to \\ndig southeastward, causing the cyclone to turn northward and \\neventually northeastward by the weekend.
